Please write your answers to the essay questions in this file.

If you have supporting evidence from any experiments that you
conducted, remember to document them here and leave the code (suitably
commented out) in the actual *.py files.  You may receive a small
number bonus points if you do so.

1. You will observe that a large portion of the terms in the
   dictionary are numbers. However, we normally do not use numbers as
   query terms to search. Do you think it is a good idea to remove
   these number entries from the dictionary and the postings lists?
   Can you propose methods to normalize these numbers? How many
   percentage of reduction in disk storage do you observe after
   removing/normalizing these numbers?

	36504	post_num.txt
	38456	post_hex.txt
	42552	post_none.txt

2. What do you think will happen if we remove stop words from the
   dictionary and postings file? How does it affect the searching
   phase?
	47660	post_no_stop

3. The NLTK tokenizer may not correctly tokenize all terms. What do
   you observe from the resulting terms produced by sent_tokenize()
   and word_tokenize()? Can you propose rules to further refine these
   results?
